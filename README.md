# graphs-jogl

My first project in Java. It was my first course work in programming at all. 

Task was to make a Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm for searchin a clothest path from one node to another in a directed weighted graph with visualisation.

I dont remember why, but it was done mainly in pure OpenGL. Fun times... It turned actually pretty good, but visuals are a litle bit unpolished.

Yaeh, judging by the last commit, it throws a heisenbug. Related to OpenGL drawer desync in my implementation.
